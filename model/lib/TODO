TODO
----

- have a command-line option to hide the floating sensors
- run through all the logs making charts of what the programs are
- model the current state of the dishwasher better:
   - use the current states as input to a real "current state" system
   - consider case:
      - start cycle
      - immediately cancel
      - start cycle
     this should be considered as three state transitions, right now it's one,
     because the currently cycle state/step doesn't change in between.
   - right now we get confused sometimes because we receive the operatingMode
     later than the cycleState and so e.g. one is still "paused" but the other
     isn't, and we think it's an inconsistent state.
- handle SIGWINCH to repaint screen
- show only as many log lines as fits on the screen
